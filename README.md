### Codespaces

[Simon Willison's article - Configure a codespace](https://til.simonwillison.net/github/codespaces-devcontainers)

[devcontainers features - listed in src directory](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main)

**Providing a link to launch the container**

Once you have added a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to a repository you can construct a link that will launch that repository as a Codespace like so:

```
https://codespaces.new/matweldon/dotfiles?quickstart=1
```

[Here's the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/setting-up-your-repository/facilitating-quick-creation-and-resumption-of-codespaces#creating-a-link-to-resume-a-codespace) for this feature.

The `?quickstart=1` parameter causes the page to consider any Codespaces you already have running against that repository and suggest using those rather than starting a new one. It's a better option in my opinion.
